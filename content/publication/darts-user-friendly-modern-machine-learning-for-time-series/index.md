abstract: We present Darts, a Python machine learning library for time series,
  with a focus on forecasting. Darts offers a variety of models, from classics
  such as ARIMA to state-of-the-art deep neural networks. The emphasis of the
  library is on offering modern machine learning functionalities, such as
  supporting multidimensional series, fitting models on multiple series,
  training on large datasets, incorporating external data, ensembling models,
  and providing a rich support for probabilistic forecasting. At the same time,
  great care goes into the API design to make it user-friendly and easy to use.
  For instance, all models can be used using fit()/predict(), similar to
  scikit-learn.
