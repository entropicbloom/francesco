I am interested in intelligence (artificial and biological), existential risks, and consciousness.

I have a formal background in computer science, deep learning and computational neuroscience, and practical experience as a data scientist in industry. In addition to solving technical problems, I like to communicate technical topics to specialized and general audiences.

Currently I am looking to enter the field of AI alignment.
